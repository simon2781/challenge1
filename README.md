## Installation

This is a webpage and doesnt require installation, but you need an internet connection to open the web page.

## Usage 

This is a webpage, I made the following edits:

index.html changed the page title to 'Welcome to Horiseon'

added ALT to the images

edited the footer text and added an email link

In CSS:

changed div to header

changed div to nav in index and css

changed benefits to an 'article' tag

class content from div to section

On my computer the edited page look great, on GitHub pages its too large.
